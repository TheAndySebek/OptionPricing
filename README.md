# OptionPricing
I am playing with the Black-Scholes model for option pricing.  I hope to progress from simple implementation to more advanced cases.
I plan to start with a basic calculator with manual inputs.
Next, I will derive the option Greeks: Delta (dPrice/dUnderlying), Gamma(dDelta/dUnderlying), Theta(dPrice/dTime), Vega(dPrive/dVolatility), and Rho (dPrice/dInterestRate)
Then, I will use financial datasets to calculate the BS price and Greeks for many options at once.
Maybe, I will learn about teachniques for calculating volatility and implement those into my 3rd step to create more accurate values, but that is a future me problem.
Right now, I am just trying to play with Python and my coursework.
If you're an employer, please hire me.
